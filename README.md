## General Usage
- Anything typed in will run the appropriate command in the terminal
- Typing "settings" will open a text file containing colour settings, do not change run-without-seperate-java-program or the "pg command will not work"
- Typing "pg" followed by the name of the program you wish to open will attempt to open that program, If that program cannot be found, it will open the program with the closest name. Programs are searched for in the folder C:\Users\USERNAME\shortcuts, any shortcuts on your desktop will automaticly be moved to this folder.
This path is not editable, to edit it you will have to recompile the java and place the new jar file in the pg folder of the DesktopCMD app.
